      Team 5032 is Meadowvale Secondary School’s robotics team, located in Mississauga, Ontario. Since our establishment in 2014, we annually compete in the First Robotics Competition. Our accomplishments include competing in the FRC provincial competition (2017) and finishing in second place for the FRC Humber College competition (2020).
	
      As firm believers of providing all students with opportunities in the STEM and Business fields, we also assist our local middle school’s First Lego League Team.
  
      Our continued growth and success over the past 7 years is a reflection of the countless members, mentors, and sponsors that have supported us throughout the years and allow us to positively impact our community by bringing people together through STEM.
