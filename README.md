# FRC 5032 Website

## WIP - Abandoned

This site is no longer being maintained, but it is kept for archive purposes. This was the last build of the website I worked on before I left the team and they focused on more important issues that arose as a result of returning to a less functional club from the pandemic. The website was replaced with a linktree as the server hosting the website was not maintained properly and it was not a priority to get it fixed.

This website is currently a work in progress. It may not look visually appealing or work as attended.

## How to run

If this your first time running the website or more modules were added just run: `npm install`. This will install all the necessary modules required for running the website.

To run a test build of the website run: `npm start`. This will launch a build of your website in your browser. This whole process could take some time.

## Important Information

First release: **Jan 29th**
Final release: **Aug 31st**

### Notes

- Try to know at least the basics of React before contributing its not that hard to learn and shouldn't take long.

- If you are going to contribute keep the styling and color scheme consistent.

- File names must be all lowercase and may include underscores (\_) or dashes (-), but no additional punctuation; This doesn't apply to classes. Use PascalCase for everything else. Keep it consistent, please.

- Use template text till buissness gives us proper text.
