### Notes

* Try to know at least the basics of React before contributing its not that hard to learn and shouldn't take long.

* If you are going to contribute keep the styling and color scheme consistent.

* File names must be all lowercase and may include underscores (_) or dashes (-), but no additional punctuation; This doesn't apply to classes. Use PascalCase for everything else. Keep it consistent, please. 

* Use template text till buissness gives us proper text.
