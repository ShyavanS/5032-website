# FRC 5032 Website

## WIP

This website is currently a work in progress. It may not look visual appealing or work as attended.

## How to run

If this your first time running the website or more modules were added just run: `npm install`. This will install all the necessary modules required for running the website.

To run a test build of the website run: `npm start`. This will launch a build of your website in your browser. This whole process could take some time.

## Important Information

Target completion date: **TBD**

### Notes

* Try to know at least the basics of React before contributing its not that hard to learn and shouldn't take long.

* If you are going to contribute keep the styling and color scheme consistent.

* Add all new content to the testing branch only merge when you are 100% confident and it got peer reviewed.

## TODO

* TBD
